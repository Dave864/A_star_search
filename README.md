The program only handles the Uniform Cost Search heuristic. There are no options to choose any other heuristic.
The program does not display the trace from the start state to the goal state if a solution is found. The program does not exit until a valid puzzle is entered, if you choose to enter a custom puzzle.
The program has only been tested on the Linux operating system. The program may not work on other operating systems.
